# CBC Week 14 Challenge: Tech Blog

## General Information

This is the week 14 challenge for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.  The goal of this project was to create a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.  This site was built using the Model-View-Controller paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
